This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: failure to handle division by zero and null or empty parameters in functions.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, resulting in runtime errors when `param2` is zero or empty.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.vbs`, adds appropriate checks for these conditions, making the function more robust and preventing unexpected crashes.
